        <h4>Eligibility</h4>
        <p>To qualify for a replacement or return, the item must be unused, in the same condition as when you received it, and in its original packaging.</p>
        <h4>Timeline</h4>
        <p>You must initiate a replacement or return request within one day of receiving your order, whether it was delivered to
        your home or picked up from the post office.</p>

        available, a similar product of equal value may be offered.
